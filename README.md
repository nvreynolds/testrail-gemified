# TestRail_gemified

`lib/testrail.rb` is taken from: https://github.com/gurock/testrail-api/

A few people have tried to make it into a gem but have not done it successfully (lack of version, misplaced files, too much refactor, etc).  This is just a wrapper.  I stake no claim to any contents in this repo.  All belongs to https://github.com/gurock and http://www.gurock.com

to install:
`gem 'testrail', :git => 'git://github.com/nvreynolds/testrail-gemified.git'`
